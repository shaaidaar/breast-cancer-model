Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning

This repository contains a Python-based machine learning pipeline to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign, using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.

⸻

📋 Project Overview

This project covers the entire machine learning workflow, including:
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data.
	•	Feature Selection to remove redundant features.
	•	Data Scaling and Preparation for improved model performance.
	•	Model Training and Evaluation with Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and KNN.
	•	Visualization of model performance using Confusion Matrices and ROC Curves.
	•	Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV) for Random Forest.

⸻

📚 Dataset

The dataset contains 569 samples with 30 numerical features extracted from digitized images of breast mass fine-needle aspirates.
Target Variable: Diagnosis (Malignant/Benign)
